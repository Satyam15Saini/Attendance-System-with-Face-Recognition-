# Attendance-System-with-Face-Recognition-
Developed an AI-powered attendance system using facial recognition that detects faces in real
time with 90%+ accuracy, registers new users with CLAHE-enhanced imaging, and prevents 
duplicate entries through 5-second notification cooldowns. The system tracks attendance via 
stable IoU-based face tracking, logs data to CSV with timestamps, and maintains optimized 
performance through frame skipping and multi-threading techniques. 

# 🚀 Features

Face Detection: Detects faces in images or video streams.
Face Recognition: Recognizes faces from a pre-trained dataset.
Easy Setup: Simple installation and usage instructions.
Scalability: Can handle large datasets for face recognition.

#⚙️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language for implementation.
OpenCV: Library used for real-time computer vision tasks, like capturing video and processing images.
face_recognition: A powerful library built on top of dlib for face recognition.
pandas: For handling and processing datasets (e.g., maintaining records of recognized faces).
NumPy: For efficient mathematical operations and array handling.
