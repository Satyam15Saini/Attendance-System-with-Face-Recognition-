# Attendance-System-with-Face-Recognition-
Developed an AI-powered attendance system using facial recognition that detects faces in real
time with 90%+ accuracy, registers new users with CLAHE-enhanced imaging, and prevents 
duplicate entries through 5-second notification cooldowns. The system tracks attendance via 
stable IoU-based face tracking, logs data to CSV with timestamps, and maintains optimized 
performance through frame skipping and multi-threading techniques.
